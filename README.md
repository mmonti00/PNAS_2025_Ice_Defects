Simulations data used for the paper: "Defects at play: Shaping the photophysics and photochemistry of ice" - M. Monti et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2025
For each ice model (defect-free, ice containing a vacancy, an ionic, and Bjerrum defects) we report: (i) ground state optimized structures (xyz files), (ii) excited state optimized structures (xyz files), (iii) linear-response differential density (cube file), (iv) HOMO and LUMO of the absorption and emission onset transitions for one structure as an example.

For all the structures, the cell size is:
